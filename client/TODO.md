# Glacier Insights Map Implementation TODO

- [x] Create GlacierMap.jsx component based on MapLibreMap, defaulting to satellite view
- [x] Integrate free glacier GeoJSON data from public source (e.g., Natural Earth glaciers)
- [x] Add map layers: polygon fills for glacier coverage (colored by loss rate), outlines, and text labels for glacier names
- [x] Implement filters/layers: toggle controls for satellite view, glacier layers, and region-based filtering
- [x] Update GlacierInsights.jsx to integrate the GlacierMap component
- [x] Test map rendering and data loading (dev server started successfully)
- [x] Verify compatibility with free APIs (using Natural Earth public dataset)
- [x] Add region zoom functionality when filter is applied
